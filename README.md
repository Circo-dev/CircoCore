CircoCore is a decentralized actor model that is

- Fast: It delivers more than 4 million messages per second on a single core
- Designed to scale
- Extendible


## Grounded computing

A scalable system can absorb new components without degradation. Components, even software components need energy, information and space, so the structure of the system has to be compatible with the physical world in order to deliver those resources to every component.

It seems that our world is three dimensional, information cannot spread faster than light, and ["time is relative"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity). Yet supercomputers still have high-dimensional hypercube network topologies, distance is only implicitly considered in obscure topics like cache-aware algoritmhs, and consistency is the holy grail of distributed computing.

This contradiction shows that current computer networks are small, meaning the number of their parts is small compared to physical systems like crystals or gases. But as we scale further, soon we will have to stop promising qualities that are incompatible with physics.

- Synchronicity is incompatible with physics.
- So is consistency.
- And higher dimensions.

Grounded computing means we try to build our systems in a way that respects the harsh reality of the universe we are living in.
